## Overview

The **PSMilkyWay** module is a collection of PowerShell scripts that ease the lookup of information about our solar system such as Planets and Moons.  This module is designed for the PowerShell programmer interested in learning about PowerShell module building.

All the scripts are functioning today individually on Windows 10 and I'm going through the labor of converting them to be available in the **PSMilkyWay** module.
